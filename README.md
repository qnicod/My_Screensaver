# My_Screensaver

In this project, you are asked to render graphical effects and animations. Rendering techniques and functions will be needed to develop complex and efficient animations. 
They might then be reused in other graphical programs like video games.
The effects can be:
-Moving or scaling entities
-Bouncing, fading, and speed modificationâ€¢
Or even more complex like noise or blur
The entities can be:
-Lines or any other 2D shapes perfect (e.g. circles) or not.
-Plain or bordered entities
-Different size and colors
Mixed up entities and effects can produce better animations.
